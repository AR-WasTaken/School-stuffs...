A peace of code, however hard it tries,
Will always be, exe-cut-able.
Though not all exetutions lead to the-expe-cted-resu-lts. 

Programing is like walking uphiiiill.
And walking uphill can_be_challengiiiing. 
But notings stops.. a fearse soal in persuit-of-a-goal. 

It is time, to run this code. 
There is nothing stoping us from reacing our goal
We have worked hard, we are reaching out, just press that buttoooon.

When we se that red, in the console logs. 
We feel like shit for a little while, 
Since it takes time, to fix mistakes, we must work hard, to correct these past mistakes. 

(out of time :sadge:)
